### Hi there, I'm sharkyboy! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Simulator on the ROBLOX platform being developed by DreamIt Studios, as well as being the `Head Developer` for Sprinklify and managing and coordinating all the development within. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything related to `Lua` and most likely maths, tho I'm not that good.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want to learn, I'm not currently open for any commission or long-term job. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can do this via discord, so here it is, `sharkyboy#2024`.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I was too lazy to edit the default README generated by this repo.
